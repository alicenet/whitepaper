\section{Technical Cryptography}
\label{sec:tech_crypto}

In this section we present in detail the specifics of the
cryptography we will be using for \LayerTwoLong{}.
At times we will be verbose in our algorithmic details
and design choices to allow others to understand our decisions.

We will begin by comparing this work with the
Ethereum Distributed Key Generation whitepaper~\cite{ethdkg}
in Sec.~\ref{ssec:ethdkg_comparison};
our design is based this paper.
Some of the implementation-specific details are covered in
Sec.~\ref{ssec:pk_curve_specifics}.
In Sec.~\ref{ssec:math_def}, we discuss the mathematics
related to pairing-based cryptography; this is integral to
our work as it is required for our group signatures.
We describe the distributed key generation protocol in
Sec.~\ref{ssec:dkg}.
Group signatures from pairing-based cryptography require
a hash-to-curve function, and we talk about our construction
based on~\cite{ft2012bnhashtocurve,boneh2019h2cBLS12}
in Sec.~\ref{ssec:hash-to-curve}.

We follow~\cite{ethdkg} in our definition of
$\parens{t,n}$-threshold system, where we need $t+1$ actors
for consensus.
Unfortunately, this is different than what was used previously,
where $\parens{t,n}$-threshold system meant $t$ actors were
needed to agree.
We keep this difference for ease of comparison with the referenced paper.
