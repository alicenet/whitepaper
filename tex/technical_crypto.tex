\section{Technical Cryptography}
\label{sec:tech_crypto}

In this section we present in detail the specifics of the
cryptography we will be using for \LayerTwo{}.
At times we will be verbose in our algorithmic details
and design choices to allow others to understand our decisions.
Due to the technical nature, some knowledge of cryptography is assumed;
these notes~\cite{notes-math-crypto} may be helpful
to understand the material here.

We will begin by comparing this work with the
Ethereum Distributed Key Generation whitepaper~\cite{ethdkg}
in App.~\ref{ssec:ethdkg_comparison};
our design is based this paper.
Some of the implementation-specific details are covered in
App.~\ref{ssec:pk_curve_specifics}.
In App.~\ref{ssec:math_def}, we discuss the mathematics
related to pairing-based cryptography; this is integral to
our work as it is required for our group signatures.
We describe the distributed key generation protocol in
App.~\ref{ssec:dkg}.
Group signatures from pairing-based cryptography require
a hash-to-curve function, and we talk about our construction
based on~\cite{ft2012bnhashtocurve,boneh2019h2cBLS12}
in App.~\ref{ssec:hash-to-curve}.

We follow~\cite{ethdkg} in our definition of
$\parens{t,n}$-threshold system, where we need $t+1$ actors
for consensus.
Unfortunately, this is different than what was used previously,
where $\parens{t,n}$-threshold system meant $t$ actors were
needed to agree.
We keep this difference for ease of comparison with the referenced paper.
