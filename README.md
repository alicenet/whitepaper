# TL;DR

Mad Network is verifiable identity of assets, orgs, or people in any market
or group. The system today allows commercial enterprises to automate
trusted transactions with each other based on certified identity of its
primitives of assets, orgs, and people.
MadNetwork's verifiable data structure is similar to a decentralized
version of
[Google's Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian/blob/master/docs/papers/VerifiableDataStructures.pdf).
